Path To Grass:

This mod lets you turn a path block into a grass block by right clicking it with a shovel. Complete with sound, 1 damage to your shovel for each block changed, and server support (version 2+)! Feel free to use any of the code for yourself!



Server Installation:

You only need this on the server, players do not need to install the mod on the client.
